Serving a node.js app using express on IIS

1. Download the iisnode.exe and run which create a template node environment on iis
- make sure that iisnode.exe will not impact other sites on IIS
- if this is completed correctly you will see your template project at http://[machinename]/node/

2. Download the url rewrite extension
- https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite
- make sure the express and url rewrite routes are working before continuing

4. replace hello.js with your projects server.js and update the web config to reflect the changes
- this will break the current state of the site so make sure to backup the express folder before this step

5. copy the rest of your project into the express folder.

6. update all routes in project to accomodate the url rewrite ex. instead of '/' is now '/node/express/pdfsplitter/'
- NOTE: there is currently an issue with using express.static to configure an assets folder for css files so paths may need to be hard coded.
